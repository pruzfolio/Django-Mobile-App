# Django Backend Basics for Mobile Apps Learning Roadmap

## 1. Beginner Level: Django Backend Basics for Mobile Apps

### Topics:
- [ ] **Introduction to Django REST Framework (DRF)**
  - [ ] Learn to create APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF) to handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - [ ] Learn about serializers, viewsets, authentication (JWT or sessions).

- [ ] **Setting Up a Mobile App Project**
  - [ ] Understand the basics of mobile development with React Native, Flutter, or Android/iOS.
  - [ ] Set up a simple mobile app that interacts with a Django backend.

- [ ] **Basic API Consumption in Mobile Apps**
  - [ ] Make basic HTTP requests from the mobile app to Django (e.g., using fetch or axios in React Native, or http in Flutter).
  - [ ] Learn about CORS and handling responses in mobile apps.

- [ ] **Authentication**
  - [ ] Implement basic authentication (e.g., login with JWT).
  - [ ] Secure API endpoints on Django with JWT or Session authentication.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Project 1: To-Do App**
  - Backend: Django with DRF to create a simple API for managing to-do items (CRUD).
  - Frontend: React Native (or Flutter) app that interacts with the Django API to fetch, add, edit, and delete to-do items.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **React Native/Flutter**: Basic components, state management, and navigation.
- [ ] **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: API creation, JWT authentication.
- [ ] **Postman/Insomnia**: API testing tools to debug backend responses.

## 2. Intermediate Level: Real-World Mobile App Integration

### Topics:
- [ ] **User Authentication and Authorization**
  - [ ] Implement token-based authentication (JWT) for login/logout.
  - [ ] Use Django REST Framework Simple JWT for token authentication.
  - [ ] Secure access to certain APIs with user roles (e.g., admin, user).

- [ ] **Mobile-Specific Features**
  - [ ] Using local storage on the mobile app (e.g., AsyncStorage in React Native).
  - [ ] Managing background tasks and notifications in mobile apps (using libraries like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)).

- [ ] **Handling Complex API Requests**
  - [ ] Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting in Django APIs.
  - [ ] Handle file uploads (images, documents) from the mobile app to Django using Django File Uploads.

- [ ] **Offline Capabilities**
  - [ ] Implement offline capabilities in mobile apps using local storage (e.g., using SQLite or Realm in React Native/Flutter).
  - [ ] Sync offline changes with the Django backend once the network is restored.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Project 2: Chat App**
  - Backend: Use Django Channels for real-time messaging.
  - Frontend: React Native/Flutter app to send and receive messages in real-time.
  - Implement token authentication and local storage to persist chat history.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **JWT**: Token-based authentication for mobile.
- [ ] **Firebase**: For push notifications and real-time data.
- [ ] **Django Channels**: For real-time communication (WebSockets).

## 3. Advanced Level: Scalable, Production-Ready Mobile Apps

### Topics:
- [ ] **Real-Time Data and Notifications**
  - [ ] Implement WebSockets in Django using Django Channels for real-time updates (e.g., chat, notifications).
  - [ ] Set up Firebase for push notifications (FCM) to send messages to mobile apps.

- [ ] **Advanced API Features**
  - [ ] Use pagination, filtering, and searching efficiently in Django to manage large datasets.
  - [ ] Implement complex queries in Django, including prefetch_related and select_related for performance optimization.

- [ ] **Push Notifications and Background Tasks**
  - [ ] Set up background tasks using Celery to send notifications or process data asynchronously.
  - [ ] Use Celery to handle time-consuming tasks such as image processing or email notifications.

- [ ] **Deployment and CI/CD**
  - [ ] Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for the mobile app and backend.
  - [ ] Use platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Render for backend deployment and App Store/Google Play for mobile app deployment.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Project 3: E-Commerce App**
  - Backend: Django with DRF for handling products, user orders, and payments.
  - Frontend: React Native/Flutter app that allows users to browse products, add to the cart, and make purchases.
  - Implement real-time order status updates and push notifications for order confirmation and shipment.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **Celery**: For asynchronous task management.
- [ ] **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: For push notifications.
- [ ] **AWS/Heroku**: For cloud hosting and CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] **PostgreSQL**: Use advanced database features in Django like Full-text search and JSONB fields.

## 4. Professional Level: Full-Scale Mobile App Backend with Django

### Topics:
- [ ] **Microservices Architecture**
  - [ ] Split Django into microservices (e.g., user service, product service, notification service).
  - [ ] Use tools like Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.

- [ ] **Scalability and Performance**
  - [ ] Optimize Django performance using caching strategies (Redis, Memcached).
  - [ ] Scale Django with Gunicorn, nginx, and AWS Load Balancer.

- [ ] **Machine Learning Integration**
  - [ ] Integrate machine learning models in Django to provide recommendations or predictive analytics (e.g., product recommendations, user behavior prediction).

- [ ] **Advanced Security**
  - [ ] Use OAuth2 for third-party authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook login).
  - [ ] Implement API rate limiting and IP whitelisting.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] **Project 4: Social Media App**
  - Backend: Django with DRF to handle posts, likes, comments, user authentication, and notifications.
  - Frontend: React Native app with advanced features such as profile management, image upload, newsfeed, and push notifications.
  - Use Celery for background image processing, FCM for real-time notifications, and OAuth for social logins.

### Tools to Learn:
- [ ] **Docker**: Containerize Django app.
- [ ] **Kubernetes**: Orchestration for microservices.
- [ ] **OAuth2**: For secure login with third-party services.
- [ ] **Redis/Memcached**: For caching.
